title: Podcast Filtering Spotify
date: 04/12/2021

I watch a decent amount of podcasts on spotify and have become a bit frustrated when searching for specific episodes of a particular show as when I go to a show's
page on spotify it doesn't allow me to filter episodes with a specific name or description.
So I built a project that allows for more effective filtering of podcasts on spotify. When you go to a podcast page on spotify it does not allow for searching for specific episodes. So this service allows for finding a podcast going to its page then filtering the episodes down with a search string. This search method just checks if the podcast episode name or description contain the string.

Was built using python flask and using vue typescript. Code is broken down based on Frontend UI and backend code.

Main issue at the moment is that when the 'Load More' button on a show page is clicked quickly multiple times it can result in duplicates being loaded into the frontend.
