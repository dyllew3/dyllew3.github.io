title: Getting data on dublin airport security times
date: 29/05/2022

Recently there been issues in dublin airport regarding long wait times, so for curiosity I've decided to
record dublin airport security times and after a year or so will release it and make some nice graphs.

## The Data

The only source I can find is the dublin airport website live departures section
which shows the security times according to dublin airport <https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/live-departures>.
This is the best data short of going down to dublin airport and living there 24/7 to accurately measure the data or breaking into
dublin airport and finding their top secret internal numbers buried deep within the heart of T1.
Only real concern I have with this data is don't know how accurate it really is and how frequently it is updated but it's coming from dublin airport directly
so I think its the best you're gonna get.

## Parsing the Data

Parsing the data is slightly annoying it is not gotten via api request so have to actually parse the html.
This could cause issues down the line should the html ever change.

## Storing the Data

Data is currently being stored on a cockroach db instance, at current rate it generates slightly less than a 1MB a day.

## Plans for the Data

Will release it after a year or so then people can do what they want with it.
