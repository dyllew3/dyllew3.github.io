Talking about the passing of my dog Patch, this website's mascot

## Patch has passed

Unfortunately my dog patch has passed away as of the 13th of October.
If you are on this site then you probably realise its named after him.
He was a good dog, loved begging for food and getting rubs and we will miss him.
He passed peacefully surrounded by his family.
I will still be using this site for any random posts I do and will keep the
patch the dog section in memory of him.

He was a very good boy.
